## Hi, Iâ€™m Will ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog! I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Mathematics at TUM, specializing in Optimization and Operations Research. I enjoy exploring math, designing algorithms, solving MIP problems, and exploring how machine learning can improve solver performance in real-world applications.    

I see learning mathematics as the process of translating someone else's language â€” their logic, structure, and notation â€” into your own way of thinking. It's about internalizing abstract ideas until they become intuitive.    

On the other hand, programming is the reverse: you take your own thoughts, your understanding of a problem, and translate them into a language the computer can understand.    

The bridge between these two worlds is the algorithm â€” a shared structure that speaks to both human reasoning and machine execution. It's where theory meets implementation, and where clarity becomes power.  

This blog is where I document my experiments, ideas, and things I wish someone had told me earlier â€” from math tricks to solver hacks to the occasional ML rabbit hole.
